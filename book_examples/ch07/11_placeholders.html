	<h2>Our modular book organization gives the trainer flexibility</h2>
	<p>In the first section or two of all our books, we present the core content
	for the book, which includes a complete subset of usable skills. After the core
	content, each section of the book is designed as an independent module. This
	means that these sections don't have to be taught in sequence. As a result, you
	can customize your courses by assigning just those sections that you want to
	teach. </p>
	<p>Whenever possible, each of the chapters is also designed as an independent
	module. When this is true, you can assign just those chapters that are right
	for your courses. This approach also makes the chapters better for on-the-job
	reference later on.</p>
	<p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>

	<h2 id="reason2">Our top-down chapter design puts the essentials first</h2>
	<p>Unlike many competing books and products, most chapters in our books have a
	unique top-down design that moves from the simple to complex. This makes it
	easier for trainees to learn. It also means that you can present the topics at
	the start of a chapter to make sure everyone understands the essential details,
	without presenting all of the topics in a chapter. Then, your trainees can
	learn the other topics on their own or as they're needed on the job.</p>
	<p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>
	
	<h2 id="reason3">Our paired-pages format helps trainees learn faster</h2>
	<p>If you page through one of our books, you'll see that all of the information
	is presented in &quot;paired pages.&quot; In each pair, the right page is a
	figure that contains the syntax, guidelines, and examples, and the left page is
	text that contains the perspective and extra explanation.</p>
	<p>One benefit of this format is that it lets trainees learn at their own pace.
	If, for example, you're a novice, you'll probably want to read the text on the
	left as you refer to the figure on the right. But if you have experience, you
	may be able to get all the information you need from the figure. Either way,
	our customers tell us that they love this presentation method because it helps
	them learn faster and better.</p>
	<p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>

	<h2 id="reason4">Our paired-pages format reinforce training on the job</h2>
	<p>On-the-job performance is the measure of a successful course. And our
	paired-pages format makes it easy for your trainees to access all the
	information you've covered long after the course is over. </p>
	<p>Instead of having to dig through the text or handouts, they can use the
	expanded table of contents or the index to find the topic they're looking for.
	Then, the figure on the righthand page will give them the details they need to
	apply what they learned in your course.</p>
	<p>This type of quick reference is absolutely essential when you're working
	with the hundreds of classes, methods, and properties of an OO language like
	Java, Visual Basic, or C#...and yet no other books offer this unique format.</p>
	<p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>

	<h2 id="reason5">Our exercises provide more practice in less time</h2>
	<p>The exercises for our books give trainees a chance to get valuable, hands-on
	experience without wasting any time. That's because we provide the starting
	code, either from our web site or the Instructor's CD, so that trainees don't
	have to enter routine code that they already know.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, these exercises guide the trainees through the application of
	what they've just learned. Sometimes, they challenge the trainees to apply what
	they've learned in new ways. And you can assign the exercises so your trainees
	do them in class or on their own.</p>
	<p>Incidentally, unlike other books, <i>our exercises never present new skills
	or information</i>. As we see it, this is the only sensible approach to text
	and exercise design. Curiously, though, the exercises in some books do present
	new skills. Unfortunately, this means that (1) trainees who don't do the
	exercises don't learn the new skills, and (2) there's no easy way for trainees
	to find the information they need if they're having trouble since the skills
	haven't been covered yet.</p>
	<p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>

	<h2 id="reason6">Our complete, real-world applications ensure mastery</h2>
	<p>From the first book we published in 1974 to the present, all of our books
	teach by presenting complete, real-world applications that include design,
	code, and all related components. These applications help your trainees get
	started quickly and also help them reach new skill levels. As we see it,
	studying applications like these is the best way to learn how all of the parts
	of an application work together, so this is an essential part of the learning
	process.</p>
	<p><a href="#">Return to top</a></p>

	<h2 id="reason7">Our books are carefully coordinated for a series of courses</h2>
	<p>Unlike other books, ours are designed and developed by a small group of
	staff writers and editors. As a result, we can and do coordinate the structure
	and contents of our books so they work together for a series of courses.</p>
	<p>This means that you won't get unnecessary duplication in two or more of our
	books. This also means that you can be sure that one of our beginning books
	really does provide all of the prerequisites for one of our advanced
	books...because we designed them that way.</p>
	<p>For instance, our COBOL, CICS, DB2, and JCL books are commonly used for a
	series of courses that teach programmers how to develop mainframe applications.
	Our two Java books are used to teach programmers how to develop web
	applications with Java servlets and JSP. And combinations of our .NET books are
	used to teach programmers how to develop either Windows or web applications
	with C# or Visual Basic.</p>
	<p>Also, because all of our books contain sections that are treated as
	independent modules, you can combine a few sections from one book with a few
	sections from another in a single course. For instance, you can combine the
	first two sections of our Visual Basic 2008 book with the first three sections
	of our ASP.NET 3.5 with VB 2008 book for a great course on ASP.NET web programming.</p>
	<p>Of course, once your trainees use one of our books, they're going to be
	asking for others. That's why you're going to be glad that our books are
	carefully coordinated. (The biggest complaint we get is that we don't offer
	more books on more subjects!)</p>

	<h2 id="reason8">Our Instructor's CDs provide everything else that trainers need</h2>
	<p>If you review the instructor's materials that come with the Instructor's CD
	for one of our books, you'll see that our CDs provide everything else you need
	for an effective course...except the busywork. That's why you should be able to
	plan and implement a course that's based on one of our books in record time.
	Once that's done, our books and instructional materials will help ensure the
	success of your course.</p>
